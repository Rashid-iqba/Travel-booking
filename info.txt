#To make hai dynamoc page in django 

django serch url in urls.py in main folder

main folder point out app/urls.py folder which is app folder and 

app/urls.py serch views.py in app folder

and now we have to make a template folder(we can change the name also)

and we have to mention template file details in settings.py in main folder

**for Example
{
     'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates/or any other name also')], 'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],
}
and make a html page in template folder

when we use template(which is dynamic page) we have to render that page
